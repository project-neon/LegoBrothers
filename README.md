# LegoBrothers

**The Legobrothers** (Super Neon Lego Brothers) are robots developed for Sumo Lego competitions under 1 kg, made by Project Neon for several robotic events. 

They are dismantled and assembled, pushed and bullied, but they're ready for any competition or challenge you throw at them.

# What competitions?
We've tried several strategies and approaches for each competition. We've tried ramps, more motors, spinning arms and more. You can find each one on it's corresponding branch.

# Software
Between competitions, we've switched from the [LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 Software v.1.31](https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads/download-software) to [ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org/), a Debian-Linux based distribution which allows you to create textual programs. It requires a bit more setting-up but once it's done it's pretty straightforward. Currently. on the `src/` folder you can find the programs we used for the most recent competition.

# Mechanics
The mechanics's part of the Brothers were built primarily using [LEGO MINDSTORMS® set](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313), 
but not limited to it. Across competitions we've tried using more motors and parts (touch sensors, different ramps). 

You can find a table with the components for a specific event in it's branch.
