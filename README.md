# Red Bull Basement

For the [Red Bull Basement Festival](https://www.redbull.com/br-pt/events/festival-red-bull-basement-2018), we used basic ramp/ram weapons, and the ev3dev tool software.

# Software
Both robots' main software was written on python and run on the [ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org/) operating system, a Debian-based Linux distribution, which is compatible with the LEGO® MINDSTORMS EV3 brick. It was built with the [ev3-lang-python](https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev-lang-python) library.

You'll need:
- a microSD card (2GB or larger) 
- know the [Python](https://www.python.org/) language
- know how to estabilish SSH connections.


We used the EV3's built-in Bluetooth to pair the Brickman and the [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)software to estabilish a SSH (Secure Shell) connection between the EV3 and our notebooks.

There are several nice tutorials avaiable, such as the one included in the ev3dev [docs](https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/) page, and the [EV3python](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3python/) tutorials by community member Nigel Ward.

# Mechanics
The mechanics's part of this robot were built primarily using [LEGO MINDSTORMS® set](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-EV3-31313), 
but not limited to it. The table below lists some of the components used in **Astrogildo** and **Biruleibe**.
